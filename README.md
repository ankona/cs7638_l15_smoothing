# PID Control Programming Exercises
This repository contains solutions to programming exercises in the udacity course (and georgia tech omscs course) "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics" lesson on PID Control.

# Topics Covered
- Path smoothing (gradient descent)
- P Controller (w/oscillation)
- PD Controller (for oscillation reduction)
- PID Controller (for solving systematic bias issues in PD)
- TWIDDLE algorithm (Coordinate Ascent) for optimizing parameters.
